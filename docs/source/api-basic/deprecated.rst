*************************************
API - Deprecated
*************************************

In earlier versions of this library, all classes of the :py:mod:`easysensors` module belonged to :py:mod:`easygopigo3` module.
This can potentially make scripts written on a older version of this not work anymore. In order to prevent this problem, we have created dummy functions
of each class of the :py:mod:`easysensors` module and placed them in :py:mod:`easygopigo3`. Since these functions take the same arguments as the classes that were in previously
and because they return an object, the scripts that were built on that long-gone API still work.

We intent to support these "dummy" functions for a while before we retire them.

In summary, the classes that are now being instantiated from the :py:mod:`easysensors` can still be instantiated from :py:mod:`easygopigo3` for a while. These classes are:


.. autosummary::
   easygopigo3.LightSensor
   easygopigo3.SoundSensor
   easygopigo3.LoudnessSensor
   easygopigo3.UltraSonicSensor
   easygopigo3.Buzzer
   easygopigo3.Led
   easygopigo3.MotionSensor
   easygopigo3.ButtonSensor
   easygopigo3.Remote
   easygopigo3.LineFollower
   easygopigo3.Servo
   easygopigo3.DHTSensor

The only exception is the :py:func:`easygopigo3.DistanceSensor` which class no longer exists in either module.
This surrogate function has the same arguments as the other classes and the only port available to use is the ``"I2C"``.
If you wish to initialize an object for the `Distance Sensor`_, a better way is just to use the :py:class:`~di_sensors.distance_sensor.DistanceSensor` class of `DI-Sensors`_ library on which this library is based upon.
