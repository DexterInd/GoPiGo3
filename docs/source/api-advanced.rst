API GoPiGo3 - Advanced
######################

============
Requirements
============

Before using this chapter's classes, you need to be able to import the following module.

.. code-block:: python

   import easygopigo3

If you have issues importing this module, then make sure that:

   * You've followed the steps found in :ref:`Getting Started <getting-started-chapter>` guide.
   * You have installed either `Raspbian For Robots`_, the GoPiGo3 `repository`_ or the `GoPiGo3 package`_ (the pip package).
   * You have the ``gopigo3`` package installed by typing the command ``pip freeze | grep gopigo3`` on your Raspberry Pi's terminal. If the package is installed, then a string with the ``gopigo3==[x.y.z]`` format will show up.

If you encounter issues that aren't covered by our :ref:`Getting Started <getting-started-chapter>` guide or :ref:`FAQ <faq-chapter>` chapter, please head over to our `forum`_.

Take note that the ``easygopigo3`` module depends on the underlying ``gopigo3`` module.  The base ``gopigo3`` module contains lower level calls that would allow you finer control over your GoPiGo3 and its functionality is available to you once ``easygopigo3`` is imported.
