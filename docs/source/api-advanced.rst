Requirements
============

Before using this chapter's classes, you need to be able to import the following modules.

.. code-block:: python

   import easygopigo3
   import gopigo3

If you have issues importing these 2 modules, then make sure that:

   * You've followed the steps found in :ref:`Getting Started <getting-started-chapter>` guide.
   * You have installed either `Raspbian For Robots`_, the GoPiGo3 `repository`_ or the `GoPiGo3 package`_ (the pip package).
   * You have the ``gopigo3`` package installed by typing the command ``pip freeze | grep gopigo3`` on your Raspberry Pi's terminal. If the package is installed, then a string with the ``GoPiGo3==[x.y.z]`` format will show up.

If you encounter issues that aren't covered by our :ref:`Getting Started <getting-started-chapter>` guide or :ref:`FAQ <faq-chapter>` chapter, please head over to our `forum`_.
