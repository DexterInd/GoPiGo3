# GoPiGo3 Installation

## Using Raspbian for Robots

If you are using Raspbian for Robots, there is no need for an installation, all of the software comes installed.  You may need to run a software update.  

You can find all software and installation for the GoPiGo3 on an SD Card by using [our operating system Raspbian for Robots](https://www.dexterindustries.com/raspberry-pi-robot-software/).  You can [download and install Raspbian for Robots for free with instructions found here](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/install-raspbian-for-robots-image-on-an-sd-card/).

You can also [purchase an SD Card with the software on it here](https://www.dexterindustries.com/shop/sd-card-raspbian-wheezy-image-for-raspberry-pi/).  

## Installing

You need internet access for the following step(s).

The quickest way for installing the GoPiGo3 is to enter the following command:
```
curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_gopigo3 | bash
```

By default, the GoPiGo3 package is installed system-wide and [script_tools](https://github.com/DexterInd/script_tools) is completely updated each time the script is ran.

If you still want to go the old route where you first clone the repo and then you run the install script, you can do it by running the following command once cloned:
```
bash update_gopigo3.sh
```

An example using options appended to the command can be:
```
curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_gopigo3 | bash -s --user-local --no-update-aptget --no-dependencies
```

## Command Options

The options that can be appended to this command are:

* `--no-update-aptget` - to skip using `sudo apt-get update` before installing dependencies. For this to be useful, `--no-dependencies` has to be not used. Applies to RFR_Tools and the GoPiGo3.
* `--bypass-rfrtools` - skips installing RFR_Tools completely.
    * `--bypass-python-rfrtools` - skips installing/updating the python package for  [RFR_Tools](https://github.com/DexterInd/RFR_Tools).
    * `--bypass-gui-installation` - skips installing the GUI packages/dependencies from [RFR_Tools](https://github.com/DexterInd/RFR_Tools).
* `--no-dependencies` - skip installing any dependencies for the GoPiGo3. It's supposed to be used on each consecutive update after the initial install has gone through.
* `--user-local` - install the python package for the GoPiGo3 in the home directory of the user. This doesn't require any special read/write permissions: the actual command used is (`python setup.py install --force --user`).
* `--env-local` - install the python package for the GoPiGo3 within the given environment without elevated privileges: the actual command used is (`python setup.py install --force`).
* `--system-wide` - install the python package for the GoPiGo3 within the sytem-wide environment with `sudo`: the actual command used is (`sudo python setup.py install --force`).

Important to remember is that `--user-local`, `--env-local` and `--system-wide` options are all mutually-exclusive - they cannot be used together.
As a last thing, different versions of it can be pulled by appending a corresponding branch name or tag.

## Minimal Installation

Now, if you only want the absolute minimum in order to get going with the GoPiGo3, you can run this command:
```bash
curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_gopigo3 | bash -s -- --bypass-gui-installation
```

This will only install the GoPiGo3 dependencies and nothing else. You still can use options such as `--user-local` or `--env-local` if you are working with a different kind of environment. Keep in mind that `--system-wide` is selected by default.

## Subsequent Updates

If the GoPiGo3 has been installed either by using the full command or the one for the minimal installation, this means you have all the packages installed already and all dependencies put in. Therefore, on subsequent installation, you can skip installing any dependency and instead just reinstall the python package of the GoPiGo3. To do this, you can run this command:
```bash
curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_gopigo3| bash -s -- --bypass-rfrtools --no-dependencies
```

Or if this is too complex, you can always stick to the command meant for the full installation or the minimal one.

## Test and Troubleshooting
You can see [the test and troubleshooting section on the GoPiGo3, including detailed information about updating the firmware, here.](https://www.dexterindustries.com/GoPiGo/get-started-with-the-gopigo3-raspberry-pi-robot/test-and-troubleshoot-the-gopigo3-raspberry-pi-robot/)
