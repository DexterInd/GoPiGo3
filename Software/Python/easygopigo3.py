             * The "*wheels*": these are just the `GoPiGo3`_'s wheels - selfexplanatory.

        The effect of this class method is that the `GoPiGo3`_ will rotate in the same spot (depending on ``degrees`` parameter), while the wheels will be describing a perfect circle.

        So, in order to calculate how much the motors have to spin, we divide the *angle* (at which we want to rotate the robot) by 360 degrees and we get a float number between 0 and 1 (think of it as a percentage).
        We then multiply this value with the *wheel circle circumference* (which is the circumference of the circle the robot's wheels describe when rotating in the same place).


        At the end we get the distance each wheel has to travel in order to rotate the robot by ``degrees`` degrees.
