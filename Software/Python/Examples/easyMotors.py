# This code is an example for controlling the GoPiGo3 motors.  This uses
# the EasyGoPiGo3 library.  You can find more information on the library
# here:  http://gopigo3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-basic.html#easygopigo3
#
# Results:  The GoPiGo3 will move forward for 2 seconds, and then
# backward for 2 second.


# import the time library for the sleep function
import time
# import the GoPiGo3 drivers
import easygopigo3 as easy

# Create an instance of the GoPiGo3 class.
# GPG will be the GoPiGo3 object.
gpg = easy.EasyGoPiGo3()

gpg.forward()

time.sleep(2)

gpg.backward()

time.sleep(2)
