# Program the GoPiGo in Scratch

You can program the GoPiGo3 with Scratch 1.4.  This repo contains support programs and example programs to help you program the [GoPiGo3](http://www.dexterindustries.com/GoPiGo3) in Scratch.

The GoPiGo3 is a delightful and complete robot for the Raspberry Pi that turns your Pi into a fully operating robot.  GoPiGo3 is a mobile robotic platform for the Raspberry Pi developed by [Dexter Industries.](http://www.dexterindustries.com/GoPiGo3).

## Sensor Placement
You can add a number of Grove sensors to the GoPiGo3.  Sensors must be placed in the correct port to work.

 	
| Sensor | Port |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Ultrasonic Distance Sensor | AD1 or AD2 |
| Button | AD1 or AD2 |
| Buzzer | AD1 or AD2 |
| LED | AD1 or AD2 |
| DHT Sensor | Serial |

Dexter Industries also provide a growing number of sensors for the GoPiGo3

| Sensor | Port |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Line Sensor | I2C |
| Dexter Distance Sensor | I2C |
