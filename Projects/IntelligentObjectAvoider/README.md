# Intelligent Object Avoider Robot

## Component Requirements

In this project, we make the `GoPiGo3` intelligently avoid obstacles. You need the following:
* [GoPiGo3](https://www.dexterindustries.com/shop/gopigo3-robot-base-kit/)
* [Distance Sensor](https://www.dexterindustries.com/shop/distance-sensor/)
* [Servo Package](https://www.dexterindustries.com/shop/servo-package/)
* Charged battery pack - it comes with the [GoPiGo3](https://www.dexterindustries.com/shop/gopigo3-robot-base-kit/), but it still requires batteries. Works with any other supply as long as it's in the `7-12V` voltage range and is able to supply larger currents (i.e. `5 amps`).

The `servo` is particularly useful, because it gives the distance sensor a 120 degrees viewing angle. The script uses a greedy-like algorithm for choosing the best path.

## Preparing It

You need to do the following things in order to be able to launch the `robot.py` script:
1. Install `scikit-learn` package. A `sudo pip3 install scikit-learn` should be enough (be mindful of whether you need to use `sudo` or not - most probably it's `sudo` that's required).
Generally, `pip` is associated for `Python 2` applications and `pip3` is associated for `Python 3` apps, so most likely, on your system, you'll have to do use the `pip3` command.
2. Plug in the servo into port `SERVO 1` of the GoPiGo3 just like in the below photo.
3. Plug in the distance sensor into any of the 2 `I2C` ports of the GoPiGo3 just like in the below photo.
4. Run the actual script. Use only `Python 3` as `Python 2` is not supported.

## Running It

In order to run it, use the following command:
```
python3 robot.py
```

Depending on how your system is set, the Python 3 executable may be set to `python` or `python3`. To find out which executable you're dealing with, use the `-V` option when
calling the executable to see which version it is: `python -V` or `python3 -V`.

In order to stop, you need to press the `CTRL-C` combination of keyboard keys. Wait a couple of seconds until it finishes exiting.

## Robot Environment

In order to test this script, create a small labyrinth for your `GoPiGo3`. Books, bags, stools can be used. Avoid creating very sharp corners in your little maze or too small "corridors" as your `GoPiGo3` can get stuck.
